# Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) - MNIST Dataset

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9), with each image being 28x28 pixels in size. The objective of this project is to classify the digits correctly based on the pixel data provided.

## Features

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: The dataset is loaded, and the images are preprocessed to be fed into the CNN model.
- **CNN Architecture**: A CNN model is designed with multiple layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
- **Model Training**: The model is trained on the training dataset, and hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs are optimized for better performance.
- **Model Evaluation**: The trained model is evaluated on the test dataset using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Visualization**: The notebook includes visualizations of the training process, loss curves, and sample predictions made by the model.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used in this project.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Used for building and training the CNN model.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For organizing and presenting the code in an interactive environment.

## Project Structure

- **`Image_Classification_using_CNN_(mnist).ipynb`**: The main notebook containing the code for data loading, model design, training, evaluation, and visualization.
